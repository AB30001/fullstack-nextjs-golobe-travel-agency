# Overview

Nordic Experiences is a TripAdvisor-style platform showcasing tours and experiences across the Nordic countries (Norway, Iceland, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark). The application is built with Next.js 14 and focuses on browsing, reviewing, and discovering amazing adventures in Scandinavia through affiliate partnerships.

The platform provides a streamlined browsing experience focused on affiliate-based bookings. Users can explore experiences, read reviews, filter by location and category, and click through to affiliate partners to complete their bookings. Authentication and payment systems are preserved in the codebase for potential future use but are not currently active.
